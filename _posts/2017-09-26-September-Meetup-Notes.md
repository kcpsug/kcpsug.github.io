title: September Meetup Notes

We did it! First meetup was a success, thanks to everyone who came and to the presenters who shared. After the presentations we had a good discussion of what everyone was working on including successes and areas of difficulty. Following up with people afterwards I think the format we may use going forward would be the following

1. Presentation (one or two presenters)
2. Prior to the meetup people share code or issues through [twitter] (a gist would work), and we discuss.

Honestly, I feel like those two items would be enough to cover a 1 - 2 hour block of time. Depending on how much community involvement for item 2 would help gauge how often we meet as a group. As always, I'm open to feedback but feel its necessary to say what I'm thinking to start the conversation. :)

Finally, slide decks. They can be found here: https://github.com/kcpsug/kcpsug.github.io/_slides
