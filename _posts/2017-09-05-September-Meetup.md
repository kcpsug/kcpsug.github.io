title: September Meetup
---

KCPSUG is pleased to announce the September Meetup on Thursday, 9/21/17. As this is our first local meetup we thought it would be best to split the time between two speakers, [Robin Haberstroh] and [Bryce McDonald], and complete the meetup with an open discussion.

## Introduction to PowerShell
[Robin Haberstroh] discusses PowerShell from a beginners perspective and provides resources to continue your learning journey.

## Automation Lifecycle

[Bryce McDonald] discusses the Automation Lifecycle, covering when to script, when to use a function, and when to create a module.
